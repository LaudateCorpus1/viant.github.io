Map Reduce has arrived! We are introducing an update to 1.0.3 that includes a built in Map Reduce to allow for even faster data processing times. Keep in mind version 1.0.3 is a soft release. Check out our updated [User Guide][userGuide] for how to implement Map Reduce.

Be sure to stay tuned for new releases and further updates.


UPDATE: Map Reduce has been officially released in version 1.1.0. We highly recommend updating version 1.0.3 to a higher version.
