For the first time, we, Viant Technology LLC, start a place to open to the open source community.  The first open source project that we open to the public is CacheStore.
The current version is 1.0.2.  Please feel free to check them out.

p.s. For Remote and Cluster, there are three downloadable formats (rpm, tar, zip) under its own repostiory.
