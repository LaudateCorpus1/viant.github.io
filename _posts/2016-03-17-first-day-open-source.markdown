For the very first time, we, Viant Technology, are contributing to the open-source community. The first open-source project that we would like to share with the community is "CacheStore." This is our home grown "NoSQL" distributed system. We've been using it for at least 5 years with 1.2 billion of records.   
The current version is 1.0.2. Please feel free to check it out.

For Remote and Cluster, there are three downloadable formats (rpm, tar, zip), each under its own repository.
