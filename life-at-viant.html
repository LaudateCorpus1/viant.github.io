  <h2>Life At The Viant Data Engineering Team</h2>

            <p>"I enjoy the independence that comes with my work, as well as the challenges involved with working with Big Data."</p>

    <p>Based at the Viant, inc. headquarters in Irvine, California, the Viant Data Engineering Team spends our time flying imaginary TIE Fighters, being tea aficionados, dodging nerf bullets (and sometimes nerf guns?!), going to Sam Woo a lot, and writing long sentences.</p>

        </div>
        <p> But sometimes, we do actual work. Building incredibly scalable distributed systems, gathering and analyzing huge data sets with over 1.2 billion records, and developing amazing products for clients is just a sample of what we do. We work in an agile environment that moves fast, but expect nothing less than top notch quality on all of our code, designs, and products. As a data marketing company, we also deal with loads of private and personal data and value honesty and integrity just as much as a brilliant engineering mind.</p>

        <p> We expect our members to be professional and have a solid work ethic, but we also like having fun. Company outings are scheduled periodically, so feel free to blow off some steam and mingle with other colleagues. Some of our outings include a trip to a game at the nearby Angel Stadium (tickets, open bar, lunch, and parking included!), and a team-building hiking trip at a trail.</p>

        <p> Software development is hard work, but it doesn’t mean you have to be hungry or thirsty. Which is why we have coffee machines, pantries stocked with snacks, instant noodles, teas, as well as other items. For added convenience, the “Work-from-Home Fridays” program allows all employees to work from home on Fridays. Additionally. you’ll be granted free access to the gym located just a short distance away. If you’ve had a particularly exhausting week, even feel free to grab a beer from the selection in the fridge and join in on “Happy Hour” Thursdays/Fridays!</p>
